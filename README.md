# üöó Hill Climb Racing Hand Gesture Control

# Introduction
Welcome to the Hill Climb Racing Hand Gesture Control project! This project allows you to play the classic game Hill Climb Racing using only hand gestures, utilizing advanced computer vision techniques. By detecting hand movements and gestures through a webcam, the program translates these gestures into game controls, offering an immersive gaming experience without the need for traditional input devices.

# Features
Gesture Control: Use hand gestures to play Hill Climb Racing.

üñêÔ∏è Open Hand (Five Fingers): Accelerate the vehicle.
‚úä Closed Fist (Zero Fingers): Reverse the vehicle.
Real-Time Processing: The application processes video input in real-time for a smooth and responsive gaming experience.

Interactive Interface: Displays the number of detected fingers on the screen for better understanding and interaction.

# Technologies Used
**Python:** The core programming language for this project.
**OpenCV:** For capturing and processing video input from the webcam.
**CvZone HandTrackingModule:** To detect hand movements and gestures accurately.
**PyAutoGUI:** To simulate keyboard inputs based on detected gestures.
**NumPy:** For numerical operations and handling image data efficiently.
